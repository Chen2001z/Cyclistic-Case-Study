## Introduction
Cylistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, operates a network of over 5800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. The marketing analyst team at Cyclistic is focused on increasing the number of annual memberships, which is seen as crucial for the company's future success.

To achieve this goal, the team aims to understand the usage patterns of casual riders compared to annual members. By analyzing these differences, the team will develop a targeted marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

### Data Sources
Cyclistic's historical trip data, specifically covering the period from January 2023 to December 2023, will be used for this analysis. The trip data has been obtained from [divvy_tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

_This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that you won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes._
